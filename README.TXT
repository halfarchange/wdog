WDog or WatchDog is a daemon coordinator and can even turns simple
programs into a daemon. The basic functionalities looks like /etc/init.d scripts 
and apachectl combined.
It simplifies the execution, stop, notify, log... of these daemons and take care
to restart them if anything has gone wrong.
It can also check the space left on disks.
If anything's wrong it will try to react accordingly by itself and in any case
will try to contact you either by email or on msn (usually both).
